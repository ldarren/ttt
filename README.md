# Tic Tac Toe Game Development Workshop: Using Events, DOM Manipulation, Array and Object Iteration

In this workshop, you will learn how to build a Tic Tac Toe game using JavaScript and HTML/CSS. You will learn how to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) to create and update the game board, handle user events such as mouse clicks, and use array and object iteration to implement game logic.

During the workshop, you will start by creating the HTML and CSS to display the game board, and then use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM to add interactivity. You will learn how to use event listeners to detect user clicks on the game board, and update the board accordingly.

Next, you will implement the game logic using arrays and objects. You will learn how to use arrays to represent the game board, and use iteration to check for wins and ties. You will also learn how to use objects to represent the game state and player information.

Finally, you will put everything together and create a fully functional Tic Tac Toe game that can be played in a web browser. By the end of the workshop, you will have a solid understanding of how to use JavaScript to create interactive web applications and games, and how to use DOM manipulation, events, arrays, and objects to build complex applications.
